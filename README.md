The Wargaming Club - A web site for managing many players playing PBEM and similar computer games with scores for wins, played and service. Also manages elimination and pyramid touraments.

This site is written in PHP for a MySQL dfatabase with Python scheduled tasks. Rather than trying to install this yourself, please contact me to discuss what you are trying to do. This is a hobby project and I am not trying to make money from it.
